# Competitive Coding Data Scraper

This project is a collection of scripts that scrape user data from competitive coding platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces. It's designed to help users track their progress and performance.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Then, you can run the scripts from the command line with the appropriate arguments.

For example, to fetch user contest ratings from Codeforces:

```bash
python scripts/<platform>.py 
```

Replace <username> with the username of the user you want to fetch data for.
